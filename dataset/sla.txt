Symphony VPDC Solution and Symphony Cloud Storage Service Service Level Agreement ("SLA")
This Service Level Attachment ("SLA" or "SLA Attachment" sets forth the applicable service levels ("Service Levels") for the Symphony Virtual Private Data Center Service ("VPDC") and the Symphony Cloud Storage Service ("Symphony Storage", collectively referred to with VPDC as "Services"), provided to Customer within a Savvis Facility. This SLA Attachment is subject to and incorporated into the Master Service Agreement, including the Savvis Service Schedule between the parties and any terms not defined in this SLA shall have the meaning set forth therein.

In the event of a Service Level Failure, Customer may be entitled to receive the applicable service credit set forth herein ("Service Credits").

 

1. Service Levels and Service Credits
 

A. VPDC Intrastructure Availability Service Level.
VPDC Service offers three Service Profiles - Premier, Balanced and Essential. "VPDC Infrastructure" includes the infrastructure components listed below for all VPDC Service Profiles:

VPDC Infrastructure Component
Data Center Power
Hosting Area Network ("HAN")

VPDC Infrastructure Availability Service Level = 100% [per calendar month]
* Network throughput is not part of VPDC Infrastructure Availability

 

If VPDC Infrastructure is subject to an Outage, a Service Level Failure shall be deemed to occur and Customer will be entitled to a Service Credit as follows:

Actual VPDC Infrastructure Availability per Calendar Month	Infrastructure Availability Service Credit based on a percentage of the MRC for the Affected Service
< 100% - = 99.50	                                          5% credit
= 99.50 - = 99.00	                                          10% credit
= 99.00 - = 98.50	                                           15% credit
= 98.50	                                                           30% credit

* Essential runs on the same SAN storage as the other Service Profiles, but only offers
a single (lowest) tier of storage, so the ILM functionality does not apply

 

VPDC Environment Availability Service Levels
Premier = 99.99%, Balanced = 99.99%, Essential = 99.9%
[per calendar month]

 

If a VPDC Environment is subject to an Outage, a Service Level Failure shall be deemed to occur and Customer will be entitled to a Service Credit as follows:

Cumulative Duration of VPDC Premier and Balanced Availability within a Calendar Month	Cumulative Duration of VPDC Essential Availability within a Calendar Month	Environment Availability Service Credit based on percentage of the MRC and Usage Charges for the Affected Service
< 99.99% - = 99.49	< 99.9% - = 99.4	5% credit
= 99.49 - = 98.99	= 99.4 - = 98.9	10% credit
= 98.99 - = 98.49	= 98.9 - = 97.9	20% credit
= 98.49 - = 97.50	= 97.9 - = 97.0	30% credit

< 99.99% - = 99.9%	                                                                10% credit
< 99.9% - = 99.0%	                                                                25% credit
< 99.0%	40% credit
 

2. Process
Customer must request any Service Credit due hereunder by submitting an e-mail to billing@savvis.com within sixty (60) calendar days of the conclusion of the month in which the Service Level Failure(s) occurs. Customer waives any right to Service Credits not requested within this sixty (60) calendar day period. Service Credits will be issued once validated by Savvis and applied toward the invoice which Customer receives no later than two (2) months following Customer's Service Credit request. All performance calculations and applicable Service Credits are based on Savvis records and data unless Customer can provide Savvis with clear and convincing evidence to the contrary within such sixty (60) calendar day period.

 

3. Limitations
This SLA provides Customer's sole and exclusive remedies for any Service interruptions, deficiencies, or failures of any kind. To clarify, such sole and exclusive remedies shall not apply to breaches of unrelated obligations under the Agreement such as infringement, confidentiality, etc. Outages, Service Levels, and Service Credits set forth in this SLA Attachment shall not apply with respect to any Excluded Events.

The Service Credits set forth herein for VPDC are not cumulative and either a VPDC Infrastructure Availability Service Credit or VPDC Environment Availability Service Credit, but not both, will be available for any single event. In no event will the Service Credits accrued in any calendar month for VPDC exceed, in the aggregate across all events, fifty percent (50%) of the MRC and related usage charges for affected individual VPDC Services for Environment Availability and thirty percent (30%) of the MRC and related usage charges for affected VPDC Services for Infrastructure Availability.

The Symphony Cloud Storage SLA measures the availability of the storage service infrastructure and is therefore only applicable to the availability of the RESTful web API service. The Symphony Cloud Storage SLA does not measure or provide an SLA regarding the availability of the connected host servers or the medium to which they are connected. In no event shall the Symphony Cloud Storage Service Credits exceed 40% of the related usage charges for the affected Symphony Cloud Storage Service Availability.

Savvis managed applications and Savvis ATS network are not included in this SLA. Client Provided Images are included in the Infrastructure Availability Service Level, but not Environment Availablity Service Level.

Because Essential VPDC Virtual Servers and Operating Systems and all Client Provided Images are not maintained or managed by Savvis after initial creation, a detailed audit of the environment may be required before support or SLA analysis can begin.

Amazon S3 SLA

http://aws.amazon.com/s3/sla/

Effective Date: June 1, 2013
This Amazon S3 Service Level Agreement (“SLA”) is a policy governing the use of Amazon Simple Storage Service (“Amazon S3”) under the terms of the Amazon Web Services Customer Agreement (the “AWS Agreement”) between Amazon Web Services, Inc. (“AWS”, “us” or “we”) and users of AWS’ services (“you”). This SLA applies separately to each account using Amazon S3. Unless otherwise provided herein, this SLA is subject to the terms of the AWS Agreement and capitalized terms will have the meaning specified in the AWS Agreement. We reserve the right to change the terms of this SLA in accordance with the AWS Agreement.
Service Commitment
AWS will use commercially reasonable efforts to make Amazon S3 available with a Monthly Uptime Percentage (defined below) of at least 99.9% during any monthly billing cycle (the “Service Commitment”). In the event Amazon S3 does not meet the Service Commitment, you will be eligible to receive a Service Credit as described below.
Definitions
“Error Rate” means: (i) the total number of internal server errors returned by Amazon S3 as error status “InternalError” or “ServiceUnavailable” divided by (ii) the total number of requests during that five minute period. We will calculate the Error Rate for each Amazon S3 account as a percentage for each five minute period in the monthly billing cycle. The calculation of the number of internal server errors will not include errors that arise directly or indirectly as a result of any of the Amazon S3 SLA Exclusions (as defined below).
“Monthly Uptime Percentage” is calculated by subtracting from 100% the average of the Error Rates from each five minute period in the monthly billing cycle.
A “Service Credit” is a dollar credit, calculated as set forth below, that we may credit back to an eligible Amazon S3 account.
Service Credits
Service Credits are calculated as a percentage of the total charges paid by you for Amazon S3 for the billing cycle in which the error occurred in accordance with the schedule below.
Monthly Uptime Percentage	                   Service Credit Percentage
Equal to or greater than 99% but less than 99.9%	10%
Less than 99%	                                        25%
We will apply any Service Credits only against future Amazon S3 payments otherwise due from you. At our discretion, we may issue the Service Credit to the credit card you used to pay for the billing cycle in which the error occurred. Service Credits will not entitle you to any refund or other payment from AWS. A Service Credit will be applicable and issued only if the credit amount for the applicable monthly billing cycle is greater than one dollar ($1 USD). Service Credits may not be transferred or applied to any other account. Unless otherwise provided in the AWS Agreement, your sole and exclusive remedy for any unavailability, non-performance, or other failure by us to provide Amazon S3 is the receipt of a Service Credit (if eligible) in accordance with the terms of this SLA.
Credit Request and Payment Procedures
To receive a Service Credit, you must submit a claim by opening a case in the AWS Support Center. To be eligible, the credit request must be received by us by the end of the second billing cycle after which the incident occurred and must include:

the words “SLA Credit Request” in the subject line;
the dates and times of each incident of non-zero Error Rates that you are claiming; and
your request logs that document the errors and corroborate your claimed outage (any confidential or sensitive information in these logs should be removed or replaced with asterisks).
If the Monthly Uptime Percentage applicable to the month of such request is confirmed by us and is less than 99.9%, then we will issue the Service Credit to you within one billing cycle following the month in which your request is confirmed by us. Your failure to provide the request and other information as required above will disqualify you from receiving a Service Credit.
Amazon S3 SLA Exclusions
The Service Commitment does not apply to any unavailability, suspension or termination of Amazon S3, or any other Amazon S3 performance issues: (i) that result from a suspension described in Section 6.1 of the AWS Agreement; (ii) caused by factors outside of our reasonable control, including any force majeure event or Internet access or related problems beyond the demarcation point of Amazon S3; (iii) that result from any actions or inactions of you or any third party; (iv) that result from your equipment, software or other technology and/or third party equipment, software or other technology (other than third party equipment within our direct control); or (v) arising from our suspension and termination of your right to use Amazon S3 in accordance with the AWS Agreement (collectively, the “Amazon S3 SLA Exclusions”). If availability is impacted by factors other than those used in our calculation of the Error Rate, then we may issue a Service Credit considering such factors at our discretion.


Amazon S3 Pricing
Pay only for what you use. There is no minimum fee. Estimate your monthly bill using the AWS Simple Monthly Calculator. We charge less where our costs are less, and prices are based on the location of your Amazon S3 bucket.

Effective Date: June 1, 2013
This Amazon RDS Service Level Agreement ("SLA") is a policy governing the use of the Amazon Relational Database Service ("Amazon RDS") under the terms of the AWS Customer Agreement (the "AWS Agreement") between Amazon Web Services, Inc. ("AWS", "us" or "we") and users of AWS’ services ("you"). This SLA applies separately to each account using Amazon RDS. Unless otherwise provided herein, this SLA is subject to the terms of the AWS Agreement and capitalized terms will have the meaning specified in the AWS Agreement. We reserve the right to change the terms of this SLA in accordance with the AWS Agreement.
Service Commitment
AWS will use commercially reasonable efforts to make Multi-AZ instances available with a Monthly Uptime Percentage (defined below) of at least 99.95% during any monthly billing cycle (the "Service Commitment"). In the event Amazon RDS does not meet the Monthly Uptime Percentage commitment, you will be eligible to receive a Service Credit as described below.
Definitions
"Monthly Uptime Percentage" for a given Multi-AZ instance is calculated by subtracting from 100% the percentage of 1 minute periods during the monthly billing cycle in which the Multi-AZ instance was "Unavailable". If you have been running that Multi-AZ instance for only part of the month, your Multi-AZ instance is assumed to be 100% available for the portion of the month that it was not running. Monthly Uptime Percentage measurements exclude downtime resulting directly or indirectly from any Amazon RDS SLA Exclusion (defined below).
"Multi-AZ instance" means an Amazon RDS for MySQL,Oracle or PostgreSQL database instance with the Multi-AZ parameter set to true.
"Unavailable" means that all connection requests to the running Multi-AZ instance fail during a 1 minute period.
A "Service Credit" is a dollar credit, calculated as set forth below, that we may credit back to an eligible account.
Service Credits
Service Credits are calculated as a percentage of the charges paid by you for the Multi-AZ instances that did not meet the Monthly Uptime Percentage commitment in a billing cycle in accordance with the schedule below.
Monthly Uptime Percentage	Service Credit Percentage
Less than 99.95% but equal to or greater than 99.0%	10%
Less than 99.0%	25%
We will apply any Service Credits only against future Amazon RDS payments otherwise due from you. At our discretion, we may issue the Service Credit to the credit card you used to pay for the billing cycle in which the unavailability occurred. Service Credits will not entitle you to any refund or other payment from AWS. A Service Credit will be applicable and issued only if the credit amount for the applicable monthly billing cycle is greater than one dollar ($1 USD). Service Credits may not be transferred or applied to any other account. Unless otherwise provided in the AWS Agreement, your sole and exclusive remedy for any unavailability or non-performance or other failure by us to provide Amazon RDS is the receipt of a Service Credit (if eligible) in accordance with the terms of this SLA.
Credit Request and Payment Procedures
To receive a Service Credit, you will need to submit a claim by opening a case in the AWS Support Center. To be eligible, the credit request must be received by us by the end of the second billing cycle after which the incident occurred and must include:

i. the words "SLA Credit Request" in the subject line;

ii. the dates and times of each Unavailability incident you are claiming;

iii. the DB Instance IDs and the AWS Regions of the affected Multi-AZ instances; and

iv. your request logs that document the errors and corroborate your claimed outage (any confidential or sensitive information in these logs should be removed or replaced with asterisks).

If the Monthly Uptime Percentage of such request is confirmed by us and is less than the Service Commitment, then we will issue the Service Credit to you within one billing cycle following the month in which the request occurred. Your failure to provide the request and other information as required above will disqualify you from receiving a Service Credit.

Amazon RDS SLA Exclusions
The Service Commitment does not apply to any unavailability, suspension or termination of Amazon RDS, or any other Amazon RDS performance issues:

(i) that result from a suspension described in Section 6.1 of the AWS Agreement;

(ii) caused by factors outside of our reasonable control, including any force majeure event or Internet access or related problems beyond the demarcation point of Amazon RDS;

(iii) that result from any voluntary actions or inactions from you or any third party (e.g., rebooting a database instance, scaling compute capacity, not scaling storage when the storage is full, misconfiguring security groups, VPC configurations or credential settings, etc.);

(iv) that result from instances belonging to the Micro DB instance class or other instance classes which have similar CPU and memory resource limitations;

(v) that result from you not following the basic operational guidelines   described in the Amazon RDS User Guide (e.g., overloading a database instance to the point it is inoperable, creating excessively large number of tables that significantly increase the recovery time etc.);

(vi) caused by underlying database engine software that lead to repeated database crashes or an inoperable database instance;

(vii) that result in long recovery time due to insufficient IO capacity for your database workload;

(viii) that result from your equipment, software or other technology and/or third party equipment, software or other technology (other than third party equipment within our direct control); or

(ix) that result from any maintenance as provided for pursuant to the AWS Agreement; or

(x) arising from our suspension and termination of your right to use Amazon RDS in accordance with the AWS Agreement (collectively, the "Amazon RDS SLA Exclusions").

If availability is impacted by factors other than those explicitly used in our Monthly Uptime Percentage calculation, then we may issue a Service Credit considering such factors at our discretion.

<99.0%	                                                   30%
Definitions
HP Cloud Block Storage refers to HP’s block storage service, and does not refer to peripheral or separate services, such as but not limited to: the HP Cloud management console, HP Cloud language bindings, HP Cloud command line tools, HP Cloud Object Storage, HP Cloud CDN, or HP Cloud Compute.

Availability of HP Cloud Block Storage (“the Service”) will be calculated at 6-minute intervals per AZ, by HP or a 3rd party of HP’s selection, for each Availability Zone (“AZ”), testing the ability of our users to perform operations of both the control plane (create, delete, attach, & detach volume API commands) and the data plane (ability to read/write from your storage volume).  During each 6-minute interval, availability will be calculated as the percentage of these test operations that succeed, and then a simple average across all 6-minute intervals within a month will calculate Monthly Availability for that AZ. For each user, in each region, HP will then take the lowest availability % they encountered in any AZ in which they had Block Storage activity during that month, as their “Monthly Availability Percentage” for that region.

Any Availability Zone in which a customer has no HP Cloud Block Storage activity, defined as having 0 quantity of “Storage Volumes and Snapshots” on their bill in a given month, will by default be deemed to have had 100% availability for that customer for the given month.

Exclusions
You are not entitled to a service credit if you are in breach of your Customer Agreement with HP, including your payment obligations.  The inability to create new block storage volumes due to exceeding your account quotas or improperly formed API requests are not covered by this SLA.

To receive a service credit, you must file for a credit within 30 days of the end of the month in which availability was not met by contacting HP via the “Contact Us” link on the www.hpcloud.com website with a description of the downtime, how you were affected, and for how long.  HP reserves the right to withhold credit if it cannot verify the downtime or you cannot show that you were adversely affected in any way as a result of the downtime.

The Service Level Agreement does not apply to any downtime, suspension, or termination of any HP services:

that result in account suspension or termination due to breach of the Customer Agreement;
caused by factors outside of our reasonable control, including any force majeure event or Internet access or related problems beyond the demarcation point of HP-controlled datacenters;
that result from any actions or inactions of you or any third party; or
that result from your equipment, software or other technology and/or third party equipment, software or other technology (other than those which are under our direct control).
The service credit remedy set forth in this Service Level Agreement is your sole and exclusive remedy for any failure to meet availability of HP Cloud Block Storage.

Definitions
HP Cloud CDN refers to HP’s CDN service, including its partner’s CDN network used to deliver files via the HP Cloud CDN service, and does not refer to peripheral or separate services, such as but not limited to: the HP Cloud management console, HP Cloud language bindings, HP Cloud command line tools, HP Cloud Compute, HP Cloud Block Storage, or HP Cloud Object Storage. The HP Cloud CDN ("Service") will be considered unavailable when, for two or more consecutive 6-minute intervals ("Intervals"), the Service fails to download a test 512kb file, tested by HP or a 3rd party of HP’s selection, within 3 seconds. The Service will be considered unavailable for both of these Intervals and any subsequent contiguous Intervals, until the Service is again able to download the test file within 3 seconds. Temporary inability of the user to modify the enable/disable status or time to live (TTL) of content for the Service is not included in this definition. "Monthly Availability %" is calculated by dividing the number of Intervals where the Service is unavailable by the total number of Intervals in a month and subtracting that result from 100%. That is, Monthly Availability % = 100% – (Number of unavailable Intervals in a month/Total number of Intervals in a Month).

Exclusions
You are not entitled to a service credit if you are in breach of your Customer Agreement with HP, including your payment obligations.

Definitions
HP Cloud Compute refers to HP’s compute service, and does not refer to peripheral or separate services, including but not limited to: the HP Cloud management console, HP Cloud language bindings, HP Cloud command line tools, HP Cloud CDN, HP Cloud Block Storage, or HP Cloud Object Storage. An "instance" means a customer’s virtual machine created within HP Cloud Compute. A "Region" represents a geographic area that is no more than 100 miles in diameter and consists of multiple physically separate Availability Zones. An "Availability Zone" is a deployment of HP Cloud Compute which consists of a separate API endpoint in which customers can choose to create instances. "Monthly Availability %" is calculated per Region on a monthly basis, as 100% minus: i) Total instance-downtime-minutes, divided by ii) Total instance-minutes "Total instance-minutes" is defined as the aggregate amount of time all instances are running for a customer during a given month in a given Region. "Total instance-downtime-minutes" is calculated as the sum of each instance's downtime minutes, during the course of a month. For each instance, "downtime minutes" are accrued starting at the beginning of the first 6 minute interval during which the instance was inaccessible and the user was unable to launch a replacement instance in the same Region, and continue until the ability to launch a replacement instance is restored, including the time that would be required for a replacement instance to become accessible.

"Inaccessible" means that the operating system in the replacement instance could not respond to API or network requests, despite proper security group configuration, for 6 minutes or more.
"Accessible" means that the operating system in the replacement instance could respond to network requests.
"Unable to launch a replacement instance in the same Region" means that a request was sent to each HP Cloud Compute API endpoint for that Region but no replacement instance actually started and became accessible.
Any Region in which a customer has no HP Cloud Compute activity, defined as having 0 "total instance-minutes" on their bill in a given month, will be deemed to have had 100% availability for that customer for the given month. To be eligible for a service credit a customer must be running or trying to run instances in more than one Availability Zone within a Region during the period of time when the customer's instances were inaccessible.

Exclusions
You are not entitled to a service credit if you are in breach of your Customer Agreement with HP, including your payment obligations. The inability to launch new instances due to exceeding your account quotas or improperly formed API requests are not covered by this SLA. To receive a service credit, you must file for a credit within 30 days following the end of the month in which availability was not met by contacting HP via the Contact Us link on the HP Cloud website with a description of the downtime, how you were affected, and for how long. HP reserves the right to withhold credit if it cannot verify the downtime or you cannot show that you were adversely affected in any way as a result of the downtime. This Service Level Agreement does not apply to any downtime, suspension, or termination of any HP services:

that result in account suspension or termination due to breach of the Customer Agreement;
caused by factors outside of our reasonable control, including any force majeure event or Internet access or related problems beyond the demarcation point of HP-controlled datacenters;
that result from any actions or inactions of you or any third party; or
that result from your equipment, software or other technology and/or third party equipment, software or other technology (other than those which are under our direct control).
 

The service credit remedy set forth in this Service Level Agreement is your sole and exclusive remedy for any failure to meet availability of HP Cloud Compute.

<99.0%	                                                30%
Definitions
This SLA addresses only the HP Cloud DNS service, and does not refer to peripheral or separate services, such as but not limited to: the HP Cloud management console, HP Cloud language bindings, HP Cloud command line tools, HP Cloud CDN, HP Cloud Block Storage, HP Cloud Object Storage, or HP Cloud Compute. An "Interval" means a consecutive 6-minute period of time. Intervals during a month in which there were no DNS requests from a given account will be considered Intervals with 100% availability for that account.

DNS Resolutions
HP Cloud DNS resolutions will be considered unavailable when, for one or more Intervals, the service fails to respond to your DNS queries. "Downtime Intervals" are accrued starting at the beginning of the first Interval during which HP Cloud DNS failed to respond to DNS queries and continue until DNS queries are being resolved successfully. In the event that DNS resolution is unavailable only for a brief period within an Interval, the entire Interval is still flagged as unavailable. "Monthly Unavailability of DNS Resolutions" is calculated on a monthly basis as follows: Total DNS resolution Downtime Intervals x 6 minutes

DNS API
The HP Cloud DNS API will be considered unavailable when, for one or more Intervals, the service fails to successfully respond to API requests. Propagation time of zones and records is not included in this definition. "Monthly Availability of DNS API %" is calculated by averaging the Interval availability % of each Interval, as described below, over the entire month. "Interval Availability of DNS API %" is calculated as follows: 100% - (total number of requests that result in errors (any 5xx code) / divided by total number of requests) during that 6-minute interval.

Exclusions
You are not entitled to a service credit if you are in breach of your Customer Agreement with HP, including your payment obligations. To receive a service credit, you must file for a credit within 30 days of the end of the month in which availability was not met by contacting HP via the Contact Us link on the HP Cloud website with a description of the downtime, how you were affected, and for how long. HP reserves the right to withhold credit if it cannot verify the downtime or you cannot show that you were adversely affected in any way as a result of the downtime. The Service Level Agreement does not apply to any downtime, suspension, or termination of any HP services:

that result in account suspension or termination due to breach of the Customer Agreement;
caused by factors outside of our reasonable control, including any force majeure event or Internet access or related problems beyond the demarcation point of HP-controlled data centers;
that result from any action or inaction by you or any third party; or
that result from your equipment, software or other technology and/or third party equipment, software or other technology (other than those which are under our direct control).

Azure: 99.95% SQL Database SLA, 500 GB DB Size, Improved Performance Self-Service Restore, and Business Continuity

Tuesday, April 29, 2014
Azure Community News SQL Server
Earlier this month at the Build conference, we announced a number of great new improvements coming to SQL Databases on Azure including: an improved 99.95% SLA, support for databases up to 500GB in size, self-service restore capability, and new Active Geo Replication support.  This 3 minute video shows a segment of my keynote where I walked through the new capabilities:

image

Last week we made these new capabilities available in preview form, and also introduced new SQL Database service tiers that make it easy to take advantage of them.

New SQL Database Service Tiers

Last week we introduced a new Basic and Standard tier option with SQL Databases – which are additions to the existing Premium tier we previously announced.  Collectively these tiers provide a flexible set of offerings that enable you to cost effectively deploy and host SQL Databases on Azure:

Basic Tier: Designed for applications with a light transactional workload. Performance objectives for Basic provide a predictable hourly transaction rate.
Standard Tier: Standard is the go-to option for cloud-designed business applications. It offers mid-level performance and business continuity features. Performance objectives for Standard deliver predictable per minute transaction rates.
Premium Tier: Premium is designed for mission-critical databases. It offers the highest performance levels and access to advanced business continuity features. Performance objectives for Premium deliver predictable per second transaction rates.
You do not need to buy a SQL Server license in order to use any of these pricing tiers – all of the licensing and runtime costs are built-into the price, and the databases are automatically managed (high availability, auto-patching and backups are all built-in).  We also now provide you the ability to pay for the database at the per-day granularity (meaning if you only run the database for a few days you only pay for the days you had it – not the entire month). 

The price for the new SQL Database Basic tier starts as low as $0.16/day ($4.96 per month) for a 2 GB SQL Database.  During the preview period we are providing an additional 50% discount on top of these prices.  You can learn more about the pricing of the new tiers here.

Improved 99.95% SLA and Larger Database Sizes

We are extending the availability SLA of all of the new SQL Database tiers to be 99.95%.  This SLA applies to the Basic, Standard and Premium tier options – enabling you to deploy and run SQL Databases on Azure with even more confidence.

We are also increasing the maximum sizes of databases that are supported:

Basic Tier: Supports databases up to 2 GB in size
Standard Tier: Supports databases up to 250 GB in size. 
Premium Tier: Supports databases up to 500 GB in size.
Note that the pricing model for our service tiers has also changed so that you no longer need to pay a per-database size fee (previously we charged a per-GB rate) - instead we now charge a flat rate per service tier.

Predictable Performance Levels with Built-in Usage Reports

Within the new service tiers, we are also introducing the concept of performance levels, which are a defined level of database resources that you can depend on when choosing a tier.  This enables us to provide a much more consistent performance experience that you can design your application around.

The resources of each service tier and performance level are expressed in terms of Database Throughput Units (DTUs). A DTU provides a way to describe the relative capacity of a performance level based on a blended measure of CPU, memory, and read and write rates. Doubling the DTU rating of a database equates to doubling the database resources.  You can learn more about the performance levels of each service tier here.

Monitoring your resource usage

You can now monitor the resource usage of your SQL Databases via both an API as well as the Azure Management Portal.  Metrics include: CPU, reads/writes and memory (not available this week but coming soon),  You can also track your performance usage relative (as a percentage) to the available DTU resources within your service tier level:

Performance Metircs

Dynamically Adjusting your Service Tier

One of the benefits of the new SQL Database Service Tiers is that you can dynamically increase or decrease them depending on the needs of your application.  For example, you can start off on a lower service tier/performance level and then gradually increase the service tier levels as your application becomes popular and you need more resources. 

It is quick and easy to change between service tiers or performance levels — it’s a simple online operation.  Because you now pay for SQL Databases by the day (as opposed to the month) this ability to dynamically adjust your service tier up or down also enables you to leverage the elastic nature of the cloud and save money.

Read this article to learn more about how performance works in the new system and the benchmarks for each service tier.

New Service-Service Restore Support

Have you ever had that sickening feeling when you’ve realized that you inadvertently deleted data within a database and might not have a backup?  We now have built-in Service Service Restore support with SQL Databases that helps you protect against this.  This support is available in all service tiers (even the Basic Tier).

SQL Databases now automatically takes database backups daily and log backups every 5 minutes. The daily backups are also stored in geo-replicated Azure Storage (which will store a copy of them at least 500 miles away from your primary region).

Using the new self-service restore functionality, you can now restore your database to a point in time in the past as defined by the specified backup retention policies of your service tier:

Basic Tier: Restore from most recent daily backup
Standard Tier: Restore to any point in last 7 days

Cloud Big Data Platform SLA
Rackspace Cloud Big Data Platform is a preconfigured group of virtual servers running Hadoop software (“Cluster”). Each Cluster is comprised of two related subsystems, the control plane and the data plane, each with its own service level guarantee. 

I. CONTROL PLANE
The “control plane” is the Cloud Big Data API (Application Programming Interface) used to create, manage, and delete Clusters. Rackspace guarantees the control plane will be available 99.9% of the time in any given monthly billing period. 

                            SLA Credit for Control Plane:     
                            Monthly Availability        Credit Percentage*
                            100% - 99.9%                               0%    
                            < 99.9% - 99.5%                          10%
                            < 99.5% - 99.0%                          20%
                            < 99.0%                                  30%

“Monthly Availability” is calculated on a per customer, per region basis, for a given monthly billing period, as follows (represented as a percentage):
                            1 – (Total API Errors)/(Total Valid API Requests) 

* Credits will be calculated as a percentage of all Cluster fees in the affected region for the monthly billing period.


II. DATA PLANE 
The “data plane” includes Clusters created via the control plane plus supporting systems and services required for the proper functioning and availability of the Clusters.  Customers manage and have full control over their Clusters and Rackspace makes the following guarantees with regards to the following supporting systems and services:  

Network
Rackspace guarantees that its data center network will be available 100% of the time in any given monthly billing period, excluding scheduled or emergency maintenance.  Network downtime exists when a Cluster is not reachable as a result of a failure in the data center network.

              SLA Credit for Network Downtime: 5% of the Cluster fees for each 30 minutes of network downtime (or portion thereof), up to 100% of the Cluster fees.**

Data Center Infrastructure
Rackspace guarantees that data center HVAC (Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning) and power will be functioning 100% of the time in any given monthly billing period, excluding scheduled or emergency maintenance.  Data center infrastructure downtime exists when a Cluster experiences a failure as a result of power or heat problems.

               SLA Credit for Data Center Infrastructure Downtime: 5% of the Cluster fees for each 30 minutes of data center infrastructure downtime (or portion thereof), up to 100% of the Cluster fees.**

Cluster Hosts
Rackspace guarantees the functioning of all Cluster hosts including the hypervisor.  If a Cluster host fails, Rackspace guarantees that restoration or repair will be complete within one hour of problem identification.  
 
              SLA Credit for Cluster Host Downtime: 5% of the Cluster fees for each additional hour of downtime (or portion thereof), after the first hour, up to 100% of the Cluster fees. **

** SLA credits will be calculated as a percentage of the Cluster fees for those Clusters adversely affected by the failure for the monthly billing period during which the failure occurred.

Cloud Databases SLA
 

Cloud Database Instances

We guarantee that your Cloud Database Instance(s) will be available 99.9% of the time in any given monthly billing period, excluding Scheduled Maintenance. This guarantee includes unavailability due to failures with the Datacenter Infrastructure (including power and network), but excludes downtime due to either Scheduled Maintenance or Instance Resize Migration (as described below).

 

Instance Resize Migration

If you request that we resize your Cloud Database Instance (such as by increasing or decreasing the amount of storage or compute resources dedicated to a given instance), the Cloud Database Instance may be unavailable during resizing as we re-provision the instance on appropriate host infrastructure. Because instance resize migration times may vary substantially based on existing image size, the availability of additional resources on the existing host, and the target instance size, Rackspace makes no guarantee about instance resize migration times and no credit is available for downtime due to a request that Rackspace resize a given Cloud Database Instance.

 

Credits

If we fail to meet a guaranty stated above, you will be eligible for a credit. Credits will be calculated as a percentage of the fees for the Cloud Databases adversely affected by the failure for the current monthly billing period during which the failure occurred (to be applied at the end of the billing cycle), as follows:

Cloud Database Instances: 5% of the Cloud Database fees for each 30 minutes of instance downtime after the first 0.1% of downtime during the month, up to 100% of the Cloud Database fees;

Definitions: For purposes of this Service Level Agreement:

"Cloud Database Instance" means your unique database instance and the availability of the storage volume provisioned for your instance as well as the API you use to administer the Rackspace Cloud Databases Service.

"Datacenter Infrastructure" means the Rackspace Cloud network which extends from the network egress point of your Cloud Database host to the data center border router, the availability of power in the data center, and the UPSs, PDUs and power cabling servicing the Cloud Database Hosts.

"Cloud Database Fees" means the fees for your Rackspace Cloud Databases for the monthly billing period in which the failure occurred.

"Scheduled Maintenance" means maintenance that is announced at least ten business days in advance, and that does not exceed sixty minutes in any calendar month.

 

Limitations

You are not entitled to a credit if you are in breach of your services agreement with Rackspace (including your payment obligations to us) until you have cured the breach. You are not entitled to a credit if downtime would not have occurred but for your breach of your agreement with Rackspace  or your misuse or administration of the Cloud Databases system (for example, if you completely fill the storage volume allocated to your Cloud Database Instance, your Cloud Database Instance may become unavailable). You are not entitled to a credit for downtime or outages resulting from denial of service attacks, virus activity, hacking attempts, or any other circumstances that are not within our control.

Root Access. Rackspace is unable to guarantee that it can properly support Cloud Database Instances with root access enabled, and you acknowledge that if we provide root access you are not entitled to a credit if downtime occurs on an instance that is root enabled.

To receive a credit, you must request a credit via your Rackspace Cloud control panel within thirty (30) days following the end of the downtime. You must show that your use of the Cloud Databases was adversely affected in some way as a result of the downtime to be eligible for the credit.

Notwithstanding anything in this Service Level Agreement to the contrary, the maximum total credit for the monthly billing period, including all guaranties, shall not exceed 100% of your Cloud Database fee for that billing period. Credits that would be available but for this limitation will not be carried forward to future billing periods.

http://www.rackspace.com/information/legal/cloud/sla#cloud_servers_next_gen_sla
Cloud Servers (Next Gen) SLA
Rackspace Cloud Servers (Next Gen) is comprised of two related subsystems, the control plane and the data plane, each with its own service level guarantee.


I. CONTROL PLANE

The “control plane” is the Cloud Servers API (Application Programming Interface) used to create, manage, and delete cloud servers.

We guarantee the Cloud Servers control plane will be available 99.9% of the time in any given monthly billing period. 

                            SLA Credit for Control Plane:     
                            Monthly Availability        Credit Percentage*
                            100% - 99.9%                               0%    
                            < 99.9% - 99.5%                          10%
                            < 99.5% - 99.0%                          20%
                            < 99.0%                                       30%

“Monthly Availability” is calculated on a per customer, per region basis, for a given monthly billing period, as follows (represented as a percentage):

                            1 – (Total API Errors)/(Total Valid API Requests) 

* Credits will be calculated as a percentage of all cloud server fees in the affected region for the monthly billing period.



II. DATA PLANE 

The “data plane” includes cloud servers created via the control plane plus supporting systems and services required for the proper functioning and availability of those cloud servers.  Customers manage and have full control over their cloud servers and Rackspace guarantees proper functioning of the following supporting systems and services:  

Network
We guarantee that our data center network will be available 100% of the time in any given monthly billing period, excluding scheduled or emergency maintenance.  Network downtime exists when a cloud server is not reachable as a result of a failure in the data center network.

              SLA Credit for Network Downtime: 5% of the cloud server fees for each 30 minutes of network downtime (or portion thereof), up to 100% of the cloud server fees.**

Data Center Infrastructure
We guarantee that data center HVAC and power will be functioning 100% of the time in any given monthly billing period, excluding scheduled or emergency maintenance.  Data center infrastructure downtime exists when a cloud server experiences a failure as a result of power or heat problems.

               SLA Credit for Data Center Infrastructure Downtime: 5% of the cloud server fees for each 30 minutes of data center infrastructure downtime (or portion thereof), up to 100% of the cloud server fees.**

Cloud Server Hosts
We guarantee the functioning of all cloud server hosts including the hypervisor.  If a cloud server host fails, we guarantee that restoration or repair will be complete within one hour.  
 
              SLA Credit for Cloud Server Host Downtime: 5% of the cloud server fees for each additional hour of downtime (or portion thereof), after the first hour, up to 100% of the cloud server fees.**

Migration
If a cloud server migration is required because of cloud server host degradation, we will notify you at least 24 hours in advance of beginning the migration, unless we determine in our reasonable judgment that we must begin the migration sooner to protect your cloud server data.  Either way, we guarantee the migration will be complete within three hours of the time we begin the migration.
 
             SLA Credit for Migration Downtime: 5% of the cloud server fees for each additional hour of downtime (or portion thereof), after the first three hours, up to 100% of the cloud server fees.**

** Credits will be calculated as a percentage of the fees for those cloud servers adversely affected by the failure for the monthly billing period during which the failure occurred.



III. DEFINITIONS AND LIMITATIONS

Definitions
For purposes of the Service Level Agreements outlined above:

•    “API error” is defined as: (i) an HTTP 5xx server error response to a valid API request or  (ii) no response to a valid API request because the API is down.  Network errors or downtime outside of the Rackspace data center network do not constitute an API error;

-------------------------------
http://www.rackspace.com/information/legal/cloud/sla#cloud_sites_sla

Cloud Sites SLA
Our no-loophole, no-legalese SLA

We'll credit your next invoice with the equivalent of 1 day's hosting fee for each 60 minutes of unscheduled downtime (up to 100% of your Cloud Sites fee for the month in which the outage occurs).  It doesn't matter why—any time your websites, email or databases are offline or not functioning as a result of a failure in our systems, data center, or network is considered downtime, and we begin counting from the minute you open a support ticket via the Cloud control panel.

That's it—we've designed our SLA to be ultra-simple. Please note that the Cloud Sites™ SLA does not cover coding or configuration errors on your part, and like all hosts, we may schedule occasional maintenance windows that will affect the availability of some services. We'll post notification of scheduled maintenance before it happens, and since we operate clusters of servers, maintenance that causes downtime should be rare.

 

Limitations

You are not entitled to a credit if you are in breach of your services agreement with  Rackspace (including your payment obligations to us) until you have cured the breach. You are not entitled to a credit if downtime would not have occurred but for your breach of your agreement with Rackspace or your misuse of the Services. You are not entitled to a credit for downtime or outages resulting from denial of service attacks, virus activity, hacking attempts, or any other circumstances that are not within our control.

To receive a credit, you must request a credit via your Rackspace Cloud control panel within thirty (30) days following the end of the outage.

Notwithstanding anything in this Service Level Agreement to the contrary, the maximum total credit for the monthly billing period, including all guaranties, shall not exceed 100% of your Cloud Sites fee for that billing period. Credits that would be available but for this limitation will not be carried forward to future billing periods.

4. The Service Level Credit shall be issued following Enstratius’ receipt of the request from Customer and its good faith determination that the reported Service Level was not caused by an Unexcused Unavailability.
